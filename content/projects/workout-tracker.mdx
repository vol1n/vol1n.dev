I built a workout tracker using full-stack Clojure with Reagent and shadow-CLJS for the frontend. I used my custom datalog database (<a href="/projects/dynalog" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">Dynalog</a>) to ensure my backend could be successfully deployed serverlessly to AWS Lambda. This was my first Clojure project and I learned a lot about the language and the ecosystem.
