I built this in a weekend for fun and because I didn't have a full stack Node/TS project in my portfolio.
The Stack:
- NextJS
- TypeScript
- tRPC
- Prisma (first time using, pretty good)
- React
- OpenAI API
It has basic CRM functionality, with some AI spice. Super stable because of full-stack typesafety.
This stack is a joy.
